# MyFlix-Movie-app
MyFlix is a Movie web application which provides users with the access to information about different movies, directors and genres. Using React, build client-side based on existing server-side code (REST API) and MongoDB database.

The building process can be devided into parts: 
- on the server-side: create a database of movies and users (a REST API) with Node.js 
- on the client-side: create the interface for users allowing them to make requests to, and receiving responses from, the server side.

First building the backend for MyFlix Movie App using MongoDB and mongoDB atlas to create and host a small API of movies. 
Then built a react application to create an interactive front-end. 

The front-end of MyFlix-Movie_App is hosted online in the same domain as myFlix REST API: Heroku.

Technologies used: MERN Stack, MongoDB and mongoDB atlas, Redux and Flux.
